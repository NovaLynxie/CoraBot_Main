            To enable it. Go into the bot's settings in 'settings/main.toml'
            Under 'Dashboard' settings, change the enableDash setting to 'true' then restart the bot.

          <p>
            If you have enabled the dashboard in the settings but still see this page, check the bot's console to see if it failed to load during bot startup.
